# dsh-superagent

> **Research prototype for reference only, not an official DeepSeek product.** This code grew out of our team's day-to-day development work, with much of the engineering done by coding agents. Treat it as research code, not production-ready software. It may still contain bugs, and its coding style and engineering practices may be inconsistent. Review and adapt it before using it in your own environment.
>
> We have adapted it for publication, so it is not identical to our internal version or the implementation described in *Exploring Super-agent Design: Towards a More Autonomous Agent System*. Some designs discussed in the article are directions for future development and are not implemented in this prototype.

> **Fork notice:** this copy is a community fork, not from DeepSeek. It targets DeepSeek Harness `0.2.2-rc.1` and adds native-Windows path support; see [FORK-NOTES.md](FORK-NOTES.md) for the change list, install steps and known limits.

dsh-superagent is a proactive coding agent for one GitHub repository, packaged as a bundle for [DeepSeek Harness](https://www.deepseek.com/en/harness/). It listens to GitHub and, optionally, Feishu. When an allowed person asks the agent for work, it opens a work item, works on it in its own agent session and directory, and answers in the original conversation, for example with a pull request. A web panel shows what needs a person.

It is also a way of working with an agent: **take as little human attention as possible, and give as much value as possible.** An agent that can act for a whole team can also waste a whole team's attention, so it acts only when asked or when a rule the team wrote allows it, and speaks only when someone must act or can use a result. [docs/000-philosophy.md](docs/000-philosophy.md) explains the principle and what it asks of the operator.

## Setup

Setup has many steps, so an agent does it with you. Ask your coding agent:

> Read SETUP.md in this repository and set up dsh-superagent with me.

It asks one short question at a time, shows the full plan once, and then installs and configures everything. [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) is what it follows.

## Development

`pnpm check` runs the typecheck, the tests under the coverage gate and the build. `pnpm test`
runs the tests without coverage; `pnpm test:coverage` writes the v8 report to `coverage/` and
fails below the thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`. CI runs `pnpm check` on every pull request and
push to `main`.

`pnpm verify:install -- --dsh <path to @deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js>` installs this checkout into a throwaway
profile with `link:`, boots it and checks the panel API; see
[docs/benchmark/install-verification.md](docs/benchmark/install-verification.md).
